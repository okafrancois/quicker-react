# Quicker React

## Description

Quicker React is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of creating React component boilerplates. With a simple command, it generates React component files, allowing developers to focus more on developing features rather than setting up boilerplate code.

## Installation

To install Quicker React globally on your machine, use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install -g quicker-react
```

## Usage

After installation, you can create a new React component by running the `quicker-react` command in your terminal. Follow the prompts to specify the component name and the directory where you want to create the component.

### Creating a New Component

Run the command:

```bash
quicker-react
```

Answer the prompts to specify your component's name and where you'd like the component to be created.

### Example

```bash
$ quicker-react
? What is the name of your component? MyComponent
? Enter a subdirectory for your component (leave empty for current directory):
```

This will create a new folder named `my-component` (if not existing already) and place a `MyComponent.tsx` file inside, following the specified structure.
